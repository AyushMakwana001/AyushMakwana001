<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I am a BCA final year student with a strong interest in full stack web development and modern web technologies. I am currently focused on building responsive, interactive, and user-friendly web applications while strengthening my front-end and back-end fundamentals through hands-on practice.

I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with intermediate experience in React.js and TypeScript. I also work with modern UI and animation tools such as Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Lenis.js to improve performance and user experience. Currently, I am expanding my back-end skill set by learning Node.js, followed by Express.js, NestJS, and Next.js, along with version control using Git and GitHub.

As part of my BCA curriculum, I have academic-level knowledge of C (including basic data structures), C++, Java, PHP, and core Python, which has helped me develop strong programming logic and problem-solving skills.

I am actively seeking entry-level opportunities or internships where I can apply my technical skills, learn from experienced professionals, and grow as a full stack web developer. I am highly motivated, eager to learn new technologies, and committed to contributing to real-world projects while continuously improving as a developer.</p>
